Historically, when computers were expensive, monstrosities only owned by large institutions and shared by multiple people, we worked on computers using [command-line interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) (CLIs). A CLI is a text-only interface into which users type text-based instructions in a [console](http://www.linfo.org/console.html) (or terminal), using specific syntax."

Some of the most popular shells are Bash, Z shell, KornShell, Command Prompt, and Windows PowerShell.

In order to ensure that what you learn here is as universally applicable as possible, we'll focus on learning portable commands, by following a set of standards for Unix-like operating systems called POSIX. This way, we'll actually be studying several shells simultaneously. We'll let you know when a command isn't POSIX-compliant."
